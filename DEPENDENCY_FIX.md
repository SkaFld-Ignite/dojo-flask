# Fixed Dependency Conflict

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

1. **Removed `llama-cookbook==0.0.5`** - This package was:
   - Not used anywhere in the codebase
   - Causing a dependency conflict with MarkupSafe versions
   - Pinning an outdated version (2.0.1) that conflicts with Flask/Werkzeug needs (>=2.1.1)

## 🚀 Next Steps:

Try building again:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## ⚠️ Note About Build Time:

You're on ARM architecture (M1/M2 Mac), so some packages like PyTorch will download large ARM-specific wheels. The first build might take several minutes. This is normal.

If you want to speed up development builds, consider:
1. Using Docker layer caching
2. Creating a base image with heavy dependencies pre-installed
3. Using BuildKit for parallel builds

## 🐳 Quick Commands:

```bash
# Clean build (if needed)
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Normal build with cache
docker-compose up --build

# Just run (no rebuild)
docker-compose up
```
